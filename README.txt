This is my Simple Calculator. A silly and simple project to learn Java coding and Github usage.
The calculator was initially an integer calculator, but changed using the BigDecimal-class. So now it also handles floats, doubles, etc.

Usage:
"java SimpleCalc number1 (+-*/) number2."
You might have to use \* instead of * because the Terminal interprets * as a wildcard.

Changelog:

Version 1.03:
- better source code - simplified by Daniel
- same functionality

Version 1.02:
- fixed basic bug (crashed when no args was used)
- better error handling when numbers are invalid.

Version 1.01:
- new usage: "java SimpleCalc number1 (+-*/) number2. You might have to use \* instead of *.
- new structure in the code.

Version 1.00:
- added this file - README.txt
