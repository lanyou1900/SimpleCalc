This is my Simple Calculator. A silly and simple project to learn Java coding and Github usage.
The calculator was initially an integer calculator, but changed using the BigDecimal-class. So now it also handles floats, doubles, etc.

Changelog:

First submission - No version number:
Usage "java SimpleCalc [add/subtract/divide/multiply] number1 number2

Second submission - No changes, just a GITHUB-test.

Version 1.00:
- added this file - README.txt

Version 1.01:
- new usage: "java SimpleCalc number1 (+-*/) number2. You might have to use \* instead of *.
- new structure in the code.
